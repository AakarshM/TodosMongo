# TodosMongo

Todos backend server created with NodeJS, Express, MongoDB. Contains authentication, storage and everything else with MongoDB. I'm still working on another version of this server that uses passportjs instead of the custom middleware to make everything simpler. So far so good.

Goals: 
(1) Create a better server with passport for easier auth
(2) Create an Android client as a frontend for this app.
